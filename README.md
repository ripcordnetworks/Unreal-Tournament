Custom Blue Prints and Levels for Unreal Tournament Pre-Alpha

This blue print is based off the v1.71 non-released version of ProMode. You are free to use the contents of this mutator however you wish with the exception that you do not utilize the ProMode name or branding. The root filename is se to "CHANGEME"  andit is required that you create a new and unique name otherwise you will cause conflicts with other morons who dont change it. If you fail to change it, you run the risk of breaking not only your mutator on the server but other peoples versions who didnt change it as well. All of the ProMode branding has been removed from the files, so please make sure you manually go through and change weapon names, mutator names and so as you see fit.  All of these elements have been changed to "CHANGEME".
